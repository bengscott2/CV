## Benjamin Scott

I’m a junior developer who thrives in a position where I’m able to take ownership of a product and be responsible for its success. For the past 8 years I worked in an environment that was always changing and required me to adapt to new situations. While I enjoyed that challenge, technology has always been my passion. From building an arcade table to automating the locks on my workshop, I find ways to make technology a part of my life. I’m looking forward to marrying my skills as a software developer with my experience as a client facing business owner in my new career. I’d like to continue to grow my technical skill to eventually be in a position where I can bridge the gap between customer and developer.


## Skills

#### Assertive Learner

I've worked hard to develop a process that enables me to be a more directed and aware developer. Learning how to learn is a big part of what I did at Makers and I wrote a bit about that [here](https://github.com/bengscott2/Blog).

- Learning JavaScript in 5 days to the point where I can create a [web app](https://github.com/bengscott2/news-summary-challenge)
<!-- - FINAL PROJECT -->
