## Benjamin Scott

I’m a junior developer who thrives in a position where I’m able to take ownership of a product and be responsible for its success. For the past 8 years I worked as an owner of a construction company in an environment that was always changing and required me to adapt to new situations. While I enjoyed that challenge, technology has always been my passion. From building an arcade table to automating the locks on my workshop, I find ways to make technology a part of my life. I’m looking forward to marrying my skills as a software developer with my experience as a client facing business owner in my new career. I will continue to grow my technical skill so that in the near future I can bridge the gap between customer and developer.


## Skills

#### Assertive Learner

I've worked hard to develop a process that enables me to be a more directed and aware developer. Learning how to learn is a part of what I accomplished at Makers and I wrote a bit about that [here](https://github.com/bengscott2/Blog). On top of that I built a JavaScript [web app](https://github.com/bengscott2/news-summary-challenge ) after spending 5 days learning the language.

#### Effective Team Member

Working in a team to me means you succeed together. In my company my employees were my team, at Makers my classmates were my team. That's why I wrote out, and shared, my review process so that my team could contribute and use it for their own [reviews](https://github.com/bengscott2/process-review-steps).

#### Part Of The Developer Community
One weekend a month I volunteer at my local CoderDojo. There I get the opportunity to teach kids how to code in a space that's free for anyone in the community. Alongside that I regularly go to tech meetups to engage with other developers in London to stay connected to the ever changing world of software development.
