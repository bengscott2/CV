## Benjamin Scott

I'm a self driven, dedicated person who's always looking to learn something new and find solutions to tough problems. My proudest accomplishment is growing a business from the ground up. It was a lot of work however I really enjoyed the challenge and experience of having to adapt to ever changing circumstances. Now I'm looking to be in a position where I can work in an industry I'm more passionate about and in an environment that I can grow in.
