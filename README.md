I’m a junior developer who thrives in a position where I’m able to take ownership of a product and be responsible for its success. For the past 8 years I worked as an owner of a construction company in an environment that was always changing and required me to adapt to new situations. While I enjoyed that challenge, technology has always been my passion. From building an arcade table to automating the locks on my workshop, I find ways to make technology a part of my life. I’m looking forward to marrying my skills as a software developer with my experience as a client facing business owner in my new career. I will continue to grow my technical skill so that in the near future I can bridge the gap between customer and developer.

## Projects

| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [I.I.A.S](https://github.com/ajosephides/i.i.a.s) | A progressive web app that allows you to get recipes based on the ingredients you have at home. This is a group project that was done with 2 other team members that gave us an opportunity to use a new library and explore progressive web apps. Check out the finished app [here](https://it-is-always-soup.firebaseapp.com/) | 1 day planning, 7 days coding, 1 long day styling. | React.js, Node.js, Ruby, Sinatra | Travis(CI), Firebase(CD), Jest, Puppeteer, Enzyme |
| [Train Times](https://github.com/bengscott2/train-times) | A CLI tool that returns train times for the tube/overground in London. This was a personal project to solve my issue with having to look up the train times so that I can time the train when leaving work. It makes API calls to the TFL API to search for the desred station and then calls to get arrival for that station. It's still a WIP as it has some issues with some stations but otherwise functional. | 3 days | Node.js | Mocha, Chai, Sinon |
| [News Summary](https://github.com/bengscott2/news-summary-challenge) | A single page web app that will retrieve headlines from The Guardian and provide you a summary of the articles with images and titles. The challenge and interesting bit about this is the entire site is built with vanilla JavaScript and a tested with a framework that I constructed.  | 2 days | Vanilla JavaScript | Custom built test framework |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/bengscott2/acebook-livewire) | This is a group project recreating Facebook that I was a part of. This full stack website will take user information and store it on a database. | 9 days | Ruby On Rails, Ruby | Heroku, Rubocop, RubyCritic, ScaffoLint, SimpleCov, Travis CI |


## Skills

#### Assertive Learner

I've worked hard to develop a process that enables me to be a more directed and aware developer. Learning how to learn is a part of what I accomplished at Makers and I wrote a bit about that [here](https://github.com/bengscott2/Blog). On top of that I built a JavaScript [web app](https://github.com/bengscott2/news-summary-challenge ) after spending 5 days learning the language.

#### Effective Team Member

Working in a team to me means you succeed together. In my company my employees were my team, at Makers my classmates were my team. That's why I wrote out, and shared, my review process so that my team could contribute and use it for their own [reviews](https://github.com/bengscott2/process-review-steps). If you keep in your team in mind and share your triumphs as well as your struggles you build a much stronger and much more effective team.

#### Part Of The Developer Community
One weekend a month I volunteer at my local CoderDojo. There I get the opportunity to teach kids how to code in a space that's free for anyone in the community. Alongside that I regularly go to tech meetups to engage with other developers in London to stay connected to the ever changing world of software development. These are a few of the regular meetups I have and will continue to attend: [Codebar](https://codebar.io/), [London Ruby Users Group](http://lrug.org/), [JS Roundabout](https://www.meetup.com/The-JS-Roundabout/).
